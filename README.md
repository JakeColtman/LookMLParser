# LookMLParser

Looker is a great tool for BI, but it has quite limited tooling.  

The aim of this project is to provide some great tooling.

In the immediate short term it will do things like static analysis and linting.

Longer term I'd like to see things like:

- autogeneration of description from documentation
- continuous deployment
- stronger checks that provided by looker tools (e.g. will the sql run, will looks run)
- naming convention enforcement
- automatic pruning of sets, columns, attributes and so on
